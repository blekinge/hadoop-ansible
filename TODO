Dask is teh new multicore framework for python
Dask works on HPC, kubernetes and YARN
Dask on Yarn: https://yarn.dask.org/en/latest/index.html
Dask is an alternative to Spark.

Jupyterhub directly on yarn:  https://jupyterhub-on-hadoop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
This bypasses the need for a project node for jupyter... :)
Jupyterhub becomes a hadoop service with a keytab, that uses proxyusers to start a jupyterlab container
